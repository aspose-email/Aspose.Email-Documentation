A **distribution list** is a pre-defined group of email recipients organized under a single list name, allowing users to send messages to multiple contacts simultaneously without entering each email address individually. Commonly used in business and organizational communication, distribution lists streamline mass emailing, improve efficiency, and ensure consistent message delivery to a specific group. They can be managed within email clients like Microsoft Outlook or email servers, supporting features such as adding or removing members, and controlling list permissions. Distribution lists are essential for targeted communication, announcements, newsletters, and collaboration within teams.

**Aspose.Email** allows you to create and manage Outlook distribution lists programmatically.
