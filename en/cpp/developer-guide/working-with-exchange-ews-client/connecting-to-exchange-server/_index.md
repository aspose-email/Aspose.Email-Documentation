The [GetEWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.clients.exchange.web_service.e_w_s_client#a1cba1af5a0bae889dedf76b9890ecb40) method instantiates and returns an [IEWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.clients.exchange.web_service.i_e_w_s_client) object that is further used to perform operations related to an Exchange mailbox and other folders. This article shows how to instantiate objects of [IEWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/cpp/class/aspose.email.clients.exchange.web_service.i_e_w_s_client).
