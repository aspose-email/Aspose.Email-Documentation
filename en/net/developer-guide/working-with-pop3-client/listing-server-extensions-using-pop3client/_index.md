Aspose.Email [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/) lets you retrieve the server extensions that a server supports such as IDLE, UNSELECT, QUOTA, etc. This helps in identifying the availability of an extension before using the client for that particular functionality. The [GetCapabilities()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/getcapabilities/#getcapabilities) method returns the supported extension types in the form of a string array.

## **Retrieving Server Extensions**

The following code sample demonstrates retrieving server extensions using ImapClient for Gmail server.
