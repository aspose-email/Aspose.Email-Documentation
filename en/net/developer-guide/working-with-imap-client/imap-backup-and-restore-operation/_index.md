To enable the MultiConnection mode, set [ImapClient.UseMultiConnection](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/usemulticonnection/) property to [MultiConnectionMode.Enable](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/multiconnectionmode/). The following code snippets demonstrate backup and restore operation with MultiConnection mode enabled.
