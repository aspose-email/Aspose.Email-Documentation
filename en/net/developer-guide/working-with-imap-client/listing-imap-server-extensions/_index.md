Aspose.Email's [ImapClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.imap/imapclient/) lets you retrieve the server extensions that a server supports such as IDLE, UNSELECT, QUOTA, etc. This helps in identifying the availability of an extension before using the client for that particular functionality. The [GetCapabilities()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/getcapabilities/#getcapabilities) method returns the supported extension types in the form of a string array. The following code snippet shows you how to retrieve extensions.
