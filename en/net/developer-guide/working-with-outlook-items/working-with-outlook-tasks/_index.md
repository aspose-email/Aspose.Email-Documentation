## **Creating, Saving and Reading Tasks**

Aspose.Email for .NET allows you to create Outlook tasks and save them to MSG format. The [MapiTask](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/) class provides a number of properties such as [PercentComplete](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/percentcomplete/), [EstimatedEffort](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/estimatedeffort/), [ActualEffort](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/actualeffort/), [History](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/history/), [LastUpdate](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/lastupdate/), and others, to accommodate and set information required for an Outlook task. This article shows how to create, save and read a [MapiTask](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/) from disk. To create and save a task to disk:

1. Instantiate a new object of the [MapiContact](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapicontact/) class.
1. Enter task property information.
1. Save the task to disc in MSG format.

The following code snippet shows you how to create, save and read Tasks.

### **Reading a MapiTask**

The [MapiContact](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapicontact/) class object is used to cast the [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/) object that loads a task from the disk as MSG format. The following code snippet shows you how to read a [MapiTask](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/).
