With POP3 accounts you can leave messages on the server when downloading and reading them. Leaving emails on the server means that they are available to other applications and individuals, for example, users who access their email from several devices. Or you might want to only download messages that meet some special criteria, for example, messages with a particular subject line. To manage email, you can;

- Read all the messages from the POP3 mail server using Aspose.Email.
- Download the messages to your local database.

The messages don't get deleted but stay on the server. The first time it runs, this process works fine. All the required messages are downloaded to the database. But the second time it runs, the same messages are downloaded because they are still on the email server. This causes duplicate records. To solve this issue, use the [Pop3MessageInfo.UniqueID](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3messageinfo/properties/uniqueid) property to check whether a message has already been downloaded. The message's unique ID must be stored in the database: it is the search key for detecting new messages.
## **Detecting New Messages**
To identify new emails from a list of emails on a POP3 server:

1. Connect to the server.
1. Get a list of emails.
1. Connect to the database.
1. Get a list of emails.
1. Compare the lists.
1. Save new emails to the database.

The process is faster when you:

1. Fetch all the unique IDs of messages into a hash table.
1. Search the hash table instead of the database for each email message in a foreach(…) loop.

Instead of querying the database for each message, requiring many database calls, this method only requires one call. The following code snippet shows you how to detect New Email messages on the POP3 server.
