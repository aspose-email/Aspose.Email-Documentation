With Aspose.Email.Exchange, developers can access Exchange Server mailboxes from their .NET applications. It provides an easy to use API for managing emails on Exchange Servers. Developers can create console, desktop or web applications that manages emails in Exchange mailboxes.
## **Aspose.Email.Exchange Sample Application**
This article demonstrates how to use [Aspose.Email.Exchange](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.exchange/index). We create a simple desktop application that connects to an Exchange Server mailbox, get the list of messages in the Inbox folder and display them on the windows form.
### **Exchange : Sample Application Steps**
1. Open Microsoft Visual Studio.
1. Create a new project. (Select the language of your choice C# or VB.NET)
1. Add a reference to the Aspose.Email.dll into your project by right-clicking the project and selecting **Add Reference** from the menu.
1. Design a Windows form like the one below:

To run the application successfully, you need the right credentials to accessing the Exchange Server. Here, we get the credential information - Exchange Server URI, username, password and domain - from the Windows form. This is a very basic sample so the message properties - subject, from and to - are simply displayed in the listbox.
### **Exchange : Code Examples**
Add the following code into the click even handler of the **List Messages** button.



{{< gist "aspose-email" "9e8fbeb51a8cbc4129dc71ca8cd55f0b" "Examples-CSharp-Knowledge-Base-AsposeEmailExchangeSampleApp-AsposeEmailExchange.cs" >}}
### **Exchange : Output**
This screenshot shows the messages fetched from the Exchange Server. The ListMessages() method returns the basic information like subject, from, to and message ID. To get the full message, call the ExchangeClient.SaveMessage() method. (Using the ExchangeClient.SaveMessage() is described in the article [Saving Messages from Exchange Server Mailbox in EML and MSG Format](/email/net/working-with-exchange-mailbox-and-messages/#saving-messages).)

## **Aspose.Email.Mime**
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an Internet standard that extends the email format to support text in character sets other than US-ASCII, non-text attachments, multi-part message bodies, and header information in non-ASCII character sets. Aspose.Email.Mime implements the MIMI protocol on .NET frameworks. It acts like a translator as it can read an email from file (.eml etc) or from memory (string). It then parses the email file or string into meaningful parts. If you want to go through an email file without getting involved with MIME protocol details, for example to extract an attachment from an email, use Aspose.Email.Mime.
### **Main features**
Aspose.Email.Mime works perfectly with Aspose.Email.Pop3 and Aspose.Email.Mail.

- [Aspose.Email.Pop3](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client) retrieves email messages from a specified mailbox.
- [Aspose.Email.Mail](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email) sends email messages to a specified mailbox.
- [Aspose.Email.Mime](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mime) is the hinge of the above two, and parses email messages.
