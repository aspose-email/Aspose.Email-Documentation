You can try all the features of Aspose.Email for free. All you need to do for this — download Aspose.Email for evaluation. 
The evaluation version of Aspose.Email is the same as the purchased download. 
You can easily make the evaluation version licensed by adding a few lines of code to apply the license.

As we have mentioned above, the evaluation version of Aspose.Email (without a license specified) provides full product functionality, but it inserts an evaluation watermark at the top of the document on any action like open, save, convert, etc.

If you want to test **Aspose.Email** without the evaluation version limitations, you can also request a **30-day Temporary License**. The free trial will give you a good idea of the service’s capabilities and let you do some early development.</br>
Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)
