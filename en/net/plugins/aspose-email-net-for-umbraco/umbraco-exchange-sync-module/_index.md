## **Introduction**
Aspose .NET Exchange Sync for Umbraco is an open source module from [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/) that links your Umbraco users/members to Microsoft Exchange contacts without requiring any other software. It uses the powerful features of [Aspose.Email for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/email-component.aspx) to allow you to easily sync your Exchange contacts and Umbraco users/members.
### **Module Features**
This initial version of the module is enriched with the following features to make the sync process effective, simple and easy to use.

- Microsoft Exchange server credentials are encrypted and saved in the database so that you donâ€™t have to enter them every time you use the module.
- Sync all or selected Exchange contacts to Umbraco and vice versa.
- Option to select one or more Umbraco user/member type when performing Exchange to Umbraco sync.
- Existence of every contact/user in the destination system is checked before migration to make sure that the sync does not create duplicate records.
- A brief summary of the sync process is shown upon completion.

We're here to solve problems, not create them.
