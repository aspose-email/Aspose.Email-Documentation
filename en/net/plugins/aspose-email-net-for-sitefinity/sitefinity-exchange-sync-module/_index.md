## **Introduction**
### **Exchange Sync Module**
Sitefinity Exchange Sync is an open source add-on from [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/) that links your Sitefinity users to Microsoft Exchange Server contacts without requiring any other software. It uses powerful features of [Aspose.Email for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/total/net) to allow you to easily sync your Exchange contacts and Sitefinity users.

This initial version of the add-on is enriched with the following features to make the sync process effective, simple and easy to use.

- Exchange server credentials are encrypted and saved in database so that you don’t have to enter them every time you use this add-on.
- Sync all or selected Exchange contacts to Sitefinity and vice versa.
- Option to select one or more Sitefinity roles when performing Exchange to Sitefinity sync.
- Existence of every contact/user in the destination system is checked before migration to make sure that the sync does not create duplicate records.
- A brief summary of the sync process is shown upon completion.

## **Support, Extend and Contribute**
### **Support**
From the very first days of Aspose, we knew that just giving our customers good products would not be enough. We also needed to deliver good service. We are developers ourselves and understand how frustrating it is when a technical issue or a quirk in the software stops you from doing what you need to do. We're here to solve problems, not create them.

This is why we offer free support. Anyone who uses our product, whether they have bought them or are using an evaluation, deserves our full attention and respect.
