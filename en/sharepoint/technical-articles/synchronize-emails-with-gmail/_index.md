## **Synchronizing Emails**
Aspose.Email for SharePoint's email conversion component is an easy-to-use tool for synchronizing emails with SharePoint’s custom list of emails. With support for popular protocols and email servers, like POP3, IMAP and Microsoft Exchange Server, Aspose.Email can connect with a variety of email servers and synchronize email. 

This article explains how to [set up Gmail](/email/sharepoint/synchronize-emails-with-gmail/) so that emails can be downloaded, [set up SharePoint](/email/sharepoint/synchronize-emails-with-gmail/) to synchronize emails and how to [run the synchronization manually](/email/sharepoint/synchronize-emails-with-gmail/).
### **Setting up Gmail**

To enable POP3 and IMAP:

1. Log in to your Gmail account and click **Settings** in the top right corner.
1. Click **Forwarding and POP/IMAP** to change POP and IMAP settings.
1. Enable POP and choose the appropriate “Enable POP” option: 
   1. **Enable POP for all mail** to download all emails (new and old).

1. Enable IMAP. 
   For IMAP, there are only two choices: 
   1. **Enable** to download all messages from your mailbox.
   1. **Disable** turns off the service. Don't select this option.
