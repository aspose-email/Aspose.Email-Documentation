Synchronize emails in SharePoint's custom list of emails with a mail server. Installing and activating Aspose.Email for SharePoint adds the **Aspose Tools** ribbon to the custom list of emails. You can define the following settings for the email synchronization:

|<p>- Mail Protocol</p><p>- POP3</p><p>- IMAP</p><p>- Microsoft Exchange</p><p>- Mail server address</p>|<p>- Port</p><p>- SSL security</p><p>- Username</p><p>- Password</p><p>- Schedule (the hours or minutes after which the synchronization will take place).</p>|
