**Welcome to Aspose.Email for Python via .NET**

Aspose.Email for Python via .NET is a suite of flexible and easy to use class libraries brought together to produce a most unique and powerful email programming component. Aspose.Email saves you time and effort by allowing you to code complex message file handling into your applications quickly and easily.

Aspose.Email implements a number of network protocols, for example SMTP, MIME, POP3, IMAP; message file formats, for example EML, MSG, MHT; mail storage formats such as PST and MBOX; to allow developers to create a wide variety of email processing applications. Aspose.Email helps developers program without getting lost in the complexities of message format detail.

Aspose.Email for Python via .NET also provides classes and algorithms that are useful for time-oriented recurrence patterns, or schedules. Many applications need to manage this type of information and describing and manipulating events is often a complex task. Aspose.Email frees programmers from these details by providing a simple, standards-based interface that supports complex patterns. The central concepts are coherent with the iCalendar RFC (2445), so it is easy to incorporate iCalendar features into your python applications.
