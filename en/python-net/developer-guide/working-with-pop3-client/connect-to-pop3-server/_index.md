## **Connect to POP3 Server Using Basic Authentication**

Aspose.Email for Python API provides the [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/) class, which enables applications to manage email boxes through the Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3). Use this class to establish a connection with a POP3 server. It serves as the primary interface for developers looking to incorporate POP3 management into their .NET applications. This article provides guidance on using Pop3Client class effectively.

The following code snippet demonstrates how to establish a connection to a POP3 email server using the Aspose.Email [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/) class. It illustrates the process of configuring the connection with essential parameters such as the server address, user credentials, security settings, and port number. This setup is necessary for fetching emails securely from a Gmail account.

1. Create an instance of [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/).
2. Specify the host, username, password, port, and security options.

## **Connect to SSL-Enabled POP3 Server**

To connect to an SSL-enabled POP3 server, use the Aspose.Email [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/) class and set the security options and port properties. The following code snippet shows you how to connect to an SSL enables POP3 server:

## **Connect to POP3 Server with APOP Authentication**

APOP (Authenticated Post Office Protocol) is a secure method for retrieving emails from a mail server. It enhances the traditional POP3 protocol by adding a layer of authentication that protects user credentials. 

Instead of sending your username and password in plain text, APOP uses a hashed value during the authentication process. Upon login, the client creates a hash using a secret key (the user's password) and a challenge value (a unique string generated by the server). 

## **Connect to POP3 Server via Proxy**

Proxy servers act as intermediaries between your email client and the mail server when communicating with the outside world. Instead of connecting directly to the mail server, your email requests traverse through a proxy, which provides several advantages, including masking your IP address and gaining access to restricted content. Using proxy servers can enhance privacy and security, especially when accessing email over public networks.  

Aspose.Email provides support for using proxy servers, specifically versions 4, 4a, and 5 of the SOCKS proxy protocol. This capability allows developers to create applications that can efficiently communicate with mail servers through proxies. Its [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/) class enables applications to access and manipulate messages using the Post Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3). One useful method is `getmailboxinfo()`, which retrieves essential information about the mailbox, such as the number of messages and total size, streamlining the management of email accounts.

The code sample below demonstrates how to retrieve email using a proxy mail server with Aspose.Email:


```py
import aspose.email as ae

client = ae.clients.pop3.Pop3Client("pop.domain.com", "username", "password")
# Set proxy address, Port and Proxy
proxy_address = "192.168.203.142"
proxy_port = 1080
proxy = ae.clients.SocksProxy(proxy_address, proxy_port, ae.clients.SocksVersion.SOCKS_V5)
client.socks_proxy = proxy
mailboxInfo = client.get_mailbox_info()
```

### **HTTP Proxy Support**

There are various types of proxies, including HTTP proxies, SOCKS proxies, and more, each serving different purposes and providing different levels of functionality. The specific steps and configurations may vary based on the type of proxy being used. The code sample below demonstrates how to set up the [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/) with the additional configuration of an HTTP proxy and fetch information about the mailbox:

```py
import aspose.email as ae

proxy = ae.clients.HttpProxy("18.222.124.59", 8080)
client = ae.clients.pop3.Pop3Client("pop.domain.com", "username", "password")
client.socks_proxy = proxy
mailboxInfo = client.get_mailbox_info()
```

## **Connect to a Server via CRAM-MD5 Authentication**

CRAM-MD5 (Challenge-Response Authentication Mechanism with MD5) is commonly used in email protocols such as POP3 and IMAP, where secure authentication is important. It provides a stronger level of security compared to plaintext password transmission. Aspose.Email for .NET allows users to securely authenticate and access email servers supporting this authentication method. 

```py
client.allowed_authentication = ae.clients.pop3.Pop3KnownAuthenticationType.CRAM_MD5
```

## **Configure Mail Operation Timeout**

Aspose.Email provides 'timeout' property of the [Pop3Client](https://reference.aspose.com/email/python-net/aspose.email.clients.pop3/pop3client/#pop3client-class) class to get or set the timeout for mail operations in order to prevent hanging or blocking, handle network or server issues, enhance responsiveness, and ensure efficient resource management. The following code sample shows how to implement the property into a project:

```py
import aspose.email as ae

client = ae.clients.pop3.Pop3Client("host", 995, "username", "password", ae.clients.SecurityOptions.AUTO)
#  60 seconds
client.timeout = 60000
```

## **Use Cryptographic Protocols with POP3 Client**

Aspose.Email supports SSL (obsolete) and TLS cryptographic protocols to provide communication security. You can enable cryptographic encryption to protect data exchange between your application and mail servers.

```
NOTE: It's important to know that you can only configure protocol versions supported by the .NET Framework. If your current .NET Framework version does not support certain protocol versions, those unsupported versions will be disregarded and skipped. This could result in a potential downgrade in TLS security level, and it's crucial to be aware that no exceptions will be raised in this situation. Developers should exercise caution to ensure the desired TLS security level is maintained based on the supported protocols in their .NET Framework environment.
```
The following code sample demonstrates how to set up a POP3 client with configurations for the TLS 1.3 encryption protocol for secure communication:

```py
import aspose.email as ae

client = ae.clients.pop3.Pop3Client("host", 995, "username", "password", ae.clients.SecurityOptions.AUTO)
client.supported_encryption = ae.clients.base.EncryptionProtocols.TLS13
```
In case of a specified encryption protocol is not supported in the current version of .NET Framework, the difference in behavior between 'SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe' method and 'SupportedEncryption' property is the following:

If 'SupportedEncryption' property is used, the email client downgrades the encryption protocol to a supported level.

If 'SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe' method is used, the email client throws exceptions.
