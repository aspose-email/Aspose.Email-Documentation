```py
import aspose.email as ae

with ae.clients.imap.ImapClient("imap.gmail.com", 993, "username", "password") as client:
    # Set SecurityOptions
    client.security_options = ae.clients.SecurityOptions.AUTO
    print(client.id_supported)

    server_identification_info1 = client.introduce_client()
    server_identification_info2 = client.introduce_client(ae.clients.imap.ImapIdentificationInfo.default_value)

    # Display ImapIdentificationInfo properties
    print(server_identification_info1)
    print(server_identification_info2)
    print(server_identification_info1.name)
    print(server_identification_info1.vendor)
    print(server_identification_info1.support_url)
    print(server_identification_info1.version)
