Some accounts on Exchange Servers have the right to access multiple mailboxes, and some users have multiple email accounts on the same Exchange Server. In both cases, users can access other user's mailboxes using Aspose.Email for Java. This API provides a mechanism for accessing folders and emails from other mailboxes using the [ExchangeClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/exchangeclient) class.
