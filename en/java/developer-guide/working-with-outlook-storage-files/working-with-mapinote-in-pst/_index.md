## **Adding MapiNote to PST**

[Create New PST, Add Sub-folders and Messages](/email/java/create-new-pst-add-sub-folders-and-messages/) showed how to create a PST file and add a subfolder to it. With Aspose.Email you can add a MapiNote to the Notes subfolder of a PST file that you have created or loaded.

Below are the steps to add MapiNote to a PST:

1. Create a template MapiNote using Microsoft Outlook and save it as an MSG file.
1. Load saved MSG note into [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapimessage/) object.
1. Create a [MapiNote](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapinote/) object and load the template MSG note.
1. Set the [MapiNote](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapinote/) properties using different methods.
2. Create a PST using the [PersonalStorage.create()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/personalstorage/#create-java.io.OutputStream-int-) method.
3. Create a pre-defined folder (Notes) at the root of the PST file by accessing the root folder and then calling the [addMapiMessageItem()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/folderinfo/#addMapiMessageItem-com.aspose.email.IMapiMessageItem-) method.

The code snippet below shows how to create a [MapiNote](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapinote/) and then add it to the Notes folder of a newly created PST file.
