## **Adding MapiJournal to PST**

[Create New PST, Add Sub-folders and Messages](/email/java/create-new-pst-add-sub-folders-and-messages/) showed how to create a PST file and add a subfolder to it. With Aspose.Email you can add MapiJournal to the Journal subfolder of a PST file that you have created or loaded. Below are the steps to add MapiJournal to a PST:

1. Create a [MapiJournal](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapijournal/) object.
1. Set the [MapiJournal](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapijournal/) properties using a constructor and methods.
1. Create a PST using the [PersonalStorage.create()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/personalstorage/#create-java.io.OutputStream-int-) method.
1. Create a pre-defined folder (Journals) at the root of the PST file by accessing the root folder and then calling the [addMapiMessageItem()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/folderinfo/#addMapiMessageItem-com.aspose.email.IMapiMessageItem-) method.

The code snippet below shows how to create a [MapiJournal](https://reference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/mapijournal/) and then add it to the Journal folder of a newly created PST file.
