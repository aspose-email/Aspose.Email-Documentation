    def add_attachments(dataDir):



        dataDir = Settings.dataDir + 'ProgrammingEmail/ManageAttachments/'



        # Create a instance of MailMessage class

        # Set Html body

            "<font color=blue>This line is in blue color</font>")

        # Set sender information

        message.setFrom(MailAddress("from@domain.com", "Sender Name", False))

        # Add TO recipients

        message.getTo().add(MailAddress("to1@domain.com", "Recipient 1", False))

        # Adding attachment
