## **Saving and Converting Messages**
Aspose.Email makes it easy to convert any message type to another format. To demonstrate this feature, the code in this article loads three types of messages from disk and saves them back in other formats. The base class SaveOptions and the classes EmlSaveOptions, MsgSaveOptions, MhtSaveOptions, HtmlSaveOptions for additional settings when saving MailMessage can be used for saving messages to other formats. The article shows how to use these classes to save a sample email as:

- EML format.
