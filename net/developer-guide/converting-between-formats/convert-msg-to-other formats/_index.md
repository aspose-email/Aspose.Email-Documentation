MSG is a file format used by Microsoft Outlook and Exchange to store individual email messages. An MSG file contains the email's data, including headers, body, attachments, and metadata. These files are typically created when an email is saved to disk from an Outlook email client. However, there are scenarios where you may need to convert MSG files to other formats for compatibility, archival, or sharing purposes. 

The primary components involved in these conversion processes include classes, methods, and enumerations that facilitate the loading, manipulation, and saving of MSG files:


- [MapiMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/) class - represents an MSG file, providing properties and methods specific to MSG format. It is used to load and manipulate MSG files before conversion.

- [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage/) class - represents an email message. It is used to hold the email content once it's converted from MSG format, and subsequently save it in the desired format. 

- [Save Options](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/#saveoptions-class) - defines the saving options and target formats for the MailMessage object. It is used to specify the format in which the MailMessage should be saved. Examples include SaveOptions.DefaultEml, SaveOptions.DefaultHtml, SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml, etc.

**Methods**

- [MapiMessage.Load](): Loads an MSG file from the specified file path into a MapiMessage object. This static method reads the MSG file and prepares it for conversion.
- [MapiMessage.ToMailMessage(Email.MailConversionOptions options = null)](): Converts the MapiMessage object to a MailMessage object. It is called on the MapiMessage object to transform it into a MailMessage for further processing and saving.
- [MailMessage.Save(string fileName, SaveOptions options)](): Saves the MailMessage object to the specified file path in the desired format. It is used to save the converted email message in various formats. Different SaveOptions are used depending on the target format.
